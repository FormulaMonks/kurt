# Kurt Adapter for OpenAI

[Kurt](https://github.com/FormulaMonks/kurt) is a TypeScript library by [Formula.Monks](https://www.formula.co/) that wraps AI SDKs, making it easy to build structured LLM-based applications (RAG, agents, etc) that work with any LLM that supports structured output (via function calling features).

This package implements an adapter for Kurt that works with [OpenAI's GPT models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).

[Read here for more information about Kurt](https://github.com/FormulaMonks/kurt/blob/main/README.md).

## Examples

[This example code](../../examples/basic/src/openai.ts) shows how to set up and use Kurt with OpenAI.
